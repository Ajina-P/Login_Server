body-parser is a middleware in Express.js used to parse the body of incoming HTTP requests (especially POST, PUT, PATCH requests) and make it accessible under req.body.

 Express does not understand the incoming request data in JSON or URL-encoded format.

 Eg: POST /api/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

Request Body: { name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' }
